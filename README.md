# LinkedSet

This repository contains an example implementation of the LinkedSet.
The LinkedSet is a combination of Linked List and Red-Black Tree data structures.
An example of a LinkedSet might be seen below.

This data structure will be helpful for the cases that we need a Sorted Linked List,
while also want to perform insertion, deletion, and search operations fast.
The full article about how I thought about this data structure can be found in [here](https://medium.com/@ahmetfurkankavraz/linkedset-1c6f386957ca).
